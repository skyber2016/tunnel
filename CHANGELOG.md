## [1.2.2] — 2026-03-17

### 🔒 Security Fix (CRITICAL)
**Hardcoded Base64 Basic Authentication credential removed from source code.**

Previously the daemon and CLI shared a hardcoded auth header (`Basic dHVubmVsOlR1bjNsQDIwMjQh`) in source. GitGuardian flagged this as an exposed secret.

**New approach — file-based random token:**
- On daemon startup, `AuthTokenStore.LoadOrGenerate()` generates a 256-bit cryptographically random Bearer token
- Token is persisted to `~/.tunnel/.auth` with `chmod 600` (owner read/write only)
- CLI reads the same file at runtime via `AuthTokenStore.Read()`
- No credentials of any kind exist in source code or compiled binaries

> **Action required:** Run `tunnel stop && systemctl --user restart tunnel` on all machines to regenerate the token. Old Basic Auth tokens are no longer accepted.

### 🔄 Changed: `tunnel reconnect`
- **Default behavior:** when called with no arguments, automatically reconnects the currently active profile (no need to pass `--profile-name`)
- `--name <alias>` — still reconnects a single port forwarding within the active profile
- `--profile-name <name>` — still explicitly reconnects a named profile
- Providing both options at once is still an error

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### `tunnel update` — swap silently failed on `/usr/local/bin/`
- `mv` to `/usr/local/bin/tunnel` requires root; commands now use `sudo mv` and `sudo chmod +x`
- `RunShell()` now throws if exit code ≠ 0 so install failures surface immediately instead of silently leaving the old binary in place

### 🛠️ DevOps

- `uninstall.sh` rewritten for `curl | bash` compatibility:
  - Confirm prompt reads from `/dev/tty` when stdin is a pipe
  - `|| true` guards on `[[ ]]` checks prevent `set -euo pipefail` early exits
  - Args passed via `bash -s -- --purge` pattern (consistent with Docker uninstall UX)

## [1.2.1] — 2026-03-17

### ✨ New: `tunnel reload`
- Re-reads `~/.tunnel/profiles.json` from disk
- If an `ActiveProfile` is stored, automatically reconnects that tunnel (including all port forwardings)
- Useful after manually editing the config file or after daemon restart

### 🔄 Changed: `tunnel use`
- Now persists the active profile name to `profiles.json` (`ActiveProfile` field) after connecting
- Allows `tunnel reload` to reconnect automatically without user re-running `tunnel use`

### 🔄 Changed: `tunnel stop`
- Now clears `ActiveProfile` in `profiles.json` so `tunnel reload` won't re-activate a stopped tunnel

### 🏗️ Infrastructure
- `ProfilesConfig` model: added `ActiveProfile?: string` field (backward-compatible, null if none)
- `ProfileService.ReloadAsync()` — re-reads config from disk
- `POST /api/reload` daemon endpoint: reload config → reconnect active profile
- `POST /api/start` now persists `ActiveProfile` after successful connect
- `POST /api/stop` now clears `ActiveProfile` after disconnect
- `ApiClient.ReloadAsync()` added

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **`tunnel status` showed empty port list** after `tunnel add` — root cause: `/api/start` only forwarded ports from config at connect time, new ports added later were not tracked. Fixed in `v1.2.0-patch` (see previous entry)

## [1.2.0] — 2026-03-17

### ✨ New: `tunnel version` / `tunnel -v`
- Displays CLI version (from compile-time `AppVersion.Current`)
- Queries daemon `/api/version` and displays daemon version side-by-side
- Gracefully shows "not running" if daemon is offline

### 🔄 Changed: `tunnel update`
- **`--version <tag>`** — target a specific release (e.g. `--version v1.2.0` or `--version 1.2.0`). Defaults to `latest`
- **MD5 checksum verification** — downloads `{binary}.md5` sidecar file and compares before installing
  - ⚠️ If no `.md5` file is published, verification is skipped with a warning (non-fatal)
- Removed `arm64` from download target — `linux-x64` only
- `User-Agent` now reports current version: `tunnel-updater/1.2.0`
- Shows `Current → Target` version line before progress bars

### 🧹 CLI Cleanup
- Removed `github.com/skyber2016/tunnel` line from CLI startup header
- Version in header now read from `AppVersion.Current` (auto-updates with code, no hardcoding)

### 🏗️ Infrastructure
- New `Tunnel.Shared/AppVersion.cs` — single source of truth for version string, shared by CLI and Daemon
- New `VersionModel` in shared models
- New `GET /api/version` daemon endpoint (no auth required)
- `ApiClient.GetVersionAsync()` added

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-17

### ✨ New Commands

#### `tunnel clean`
- Prompts for confirmation before wiping everything
- Stops the active tunnel (if running)
- Overwrites `~/.tunnel/profiles.json` with an empty config
- Guides user to create a new profile after reset

#### `tunnel remove`
- `--name <alias>` — remove a named port forwarding rule from the active profile (with confirm)
- `--profile-name <name>` — delete an entire profile; auto-stops tunnel if profile is active

#### `tunnel reconnect`
- `--profile-name <name>` — close and reopen the full SSH connection and all port forwarders
- `--name <alias>` — stop and restart a single named port forwarding within the active profile

### 🔄 Changed Commands

#### `tunnel add`
- **Breaking:** removed positional `<profile>` argument
- Added `--name <alias>` (required) — unique identifier for `tunnel remove` / `tunnel reconnect`
- Requires an **active profile** (`tunnel use <name>` first) — adds to current profile automatically
- Validates that the alias is unique within the profile

#### `tunnel list`
- New column layout: **Profile | Host | User | Ports | Status**
- Active profile shown with `● ACTIVE` badge (green)
- Falls back to local-only display if daemon is offline

#### `tunnel status`
- New column layout: **Name | Profile | Local Port | Remote Host | Remote Port | Status**
- Requires an active profile — shows helpful hint if idle
- Per-port `● OPEN` / `○ CLOSED` badges

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **CS0104 ambiguous reference** — `ConnectionInfo` was ambiguous between `Renci.SshNet.ConnectionInfo` and `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.ConnectionInfo`; resolved with a using alias in `TunnelService.cs`

### 🏗️ Infrastructure

- Dropped **linux-arm64** build target. Only `linux-x64` is released.
- `PortMapping` model: added `Name` field (profile configs must be updated)
- `PortStatus` model: added `Name` and `Profile` fields
- New API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/remove/port`
  - `POST /api/remove/profile`
  - `POST /api/reconnect`
  - `POST /api/clean`
- `TunnelService` now tracks `(PortMapping, ForwardedPortLocal)` tuples to enable named port management

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`tunnel add` signature changed.** Scripts using `tunnel add <profile> --local ... --remote ...` must be updated to `tunnel use <profile>` first, then `tunnel add --name <alias> --local ... --remote ...`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Existing `profiles.json` files** without a `name` field on port mappings are still loadable (name defaults to empty string), but `tunnel remove --name` and `tunnel reconnect --name` require a non-empty name. Re-add ports with `tunnel add --name` to use these features.
